    "# Assignment 1: Inventory Management with `while`, `break`, `continue`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**  \n",
    "You are managing a warehouse receiving daily shipments of products. Each shipment contains a certain quantity of items. Your goal is to process these shipments one by one, keep track of how many items you have processed, skip shipments that have zero quantity, and stop processing once the total processed items exceed a safety threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "This assignment helps you practice using the `while` loop together with control statements `break` and `continue` to manage flow control in loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a list named `daily_shipments` with 50 random integers representing shipment quantities. Values range from 0 (no shipment) to 20 items.  \n",
    "2. Use a `while` loop to iterate through this list, processing one shipment at a time.  \n",
    "3. If a shipment has zero quantity, skip processing it and continue to the next shipment using the `continue` statement.  \n",
    "4. Maintain a running total of the processed shipment quantities.  \n",
    "5. If the running total exceeds 300 items, immediately stop processing further shipments by using `break`.  \n",
    "6. After the loop finishes, print the total number of processed items.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `import random` and `random.randint(0, 20)` to generate the shipment data.  \n",
    "- Use an index variable to move through the list inside the `while` loop.  \n",
    "- Remember to increment the index inside the loop to avoid infinite looping.  \n",
    "- Use `continue` to skip zero-quantity shipments and `break` to stop when total is too large.\n",

    "## Sample output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Shipments: [18, 13, 10, 9, 13, 14, 8, 20, 12, 6, 6, 18, 13, 19, 13, 17, 7, 15, 0, 17, 5, 1, 19, 4, 18, 6, 5, 7, 9, 9, 1, 16, 6, 4, 10, 1, 13, 19, 13, 4, 5, 0, 12, 10, 2, 15, 2, 5, 13, 5]\n",
