    "Let‚Äôs start with the question, how does one become an intellectual? Well, it often involves a lot of dedication to studying and research. If we don‚Äôt put the time in, we risk experiencing something psychologists call the Dunning-Kruger effect, a situation where people with limited knowledge of a given topic significantly overestimate their understanding. Unfortunately, the average person doesn‚Äôt have time to dedicate hours to research, which is why modern intellectuals are turning to an app called Blinkist.\n",
    "Even Apple recommends Blinkist for those who are lifelong learners, naming it one of the best apps in the world. Blinkist also appears to be one of the most important apps for everyday use with the new iPhone 16. With iPhone 16‚Äôs new features, Blinkist is now an even better experience for curious minds.\n",
    "At Blinkist, we gather the key insights from nonfiction books into 15 minute reads and listens. There are over 5,700 titles across 27 categories including entrepreneurship, management and leadership, and personal development.  \n",
    "More than 30 million people, among them Apple CEO Tim Cook and podcast host Joe Rogan, are now expanding their horizons with Blinkist. Tim Cook even stopped by the Blinkist office to get a glimpse of the hype, and the app is loved by everyone from The New York Times to Forbes.\n",
