    "**Scenario:**  \n",
    "You are managing a warehouse receiving daily shipments of products. Each shipment contains a certain quantity of items. Your goal is to process these shipments one by one, keep track of how many items you have processed, skip shipments that have zero quantity, and stop processing once the total processed items exceed a safety threshold.\n",
    "\n",

    "This assignment helps you practice using the `while` loop together with control statements `break` and `continue` to manage flow control in loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Create a list named `daily_shipments` with 50 random integers representing shipment quantities. Values range from 0 (no shipment) to 20 items.  \n",
    "2. Use a `while` loop to iterate through this list, processing one shipment at a time.  \n",
    "3. If a shipment has zero quantity, skip processing it and continue to the next shipment using the `continue` statement.  \n",
    "4. Maintain a running total of the processed shipment quantities.  \n",
